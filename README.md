Extensions methods that adds functionality to Dart objects

This repository contains examples and explanations for using extension methods in Dart. Extension methods allow developers to add functionality to existing classes without modifying the original class.

## Getting Started

To use these examples, you will need to have Dart installed on your machine. You can download and install Dart from the official website [https://dart.dev/get-dart](https://dart.dev/get-dart), or you can quickly get started by using [dartpad](https://dartpad.dev/).

## Examples

The examples in this repository demonstrate how to use extension methods with different Dart classes. Each example is contained in its own file and includes comments explaining the code.
